     * This is how it works:

    The when variable (day) is evaluated once
    The value of the day variable is compared with the values of each "branch"
    Each branch starts with a value, followed by an arrow (->) and a result
    If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed
    else is used to specify some code to run if there is no match
    In the example above, the value of day is 4, meaning "Thursday" will be printed
